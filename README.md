# offkeyboard-windows

If you're looking for installation, and how this works, try the parent repository.

So this is a fork of offkeyboard but for Windows. This is mainly for my personal use, but others can try it out too.
(Keybinds might be a bit weird on here)

Basically this is just the parent repository, but with different libraries more suited for Windows and DirectX input. (Don't look in dxscancode.py I beg of you)

So yeah that's about it, hopefully this works.
